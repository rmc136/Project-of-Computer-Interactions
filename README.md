This project had the goal to simulate the front-end of a SmartHomeApplication using JavaScript and CSS according with the "Cen√°rios de Tarefas Finais_012.pdf" fucntionalities written in them (in portuguese). A lot of the buttons don't work
because those buttons fucntionalities weren't descibed in the pdf mentioned above. Also i made a presentation about the steps of creation of these project.
