This project had the goal to simulate the front-end of a SmartHomeApplication using HTML, JavaScript and CSS according with the "Cen√°rios de Tarefas Finais_012.pdf" functionalities written in them (in Portuguese). A lot of the buttons don't work
because those buttons functionalities weren't described in the pdf mentioned above. Also, I made a presentation about the steps of creation of these project.
